The problem was likely due to an incorrect or incomplete `content` array within the `tailwind.config.js` file. The content array should explicitly include all files and directories where you use Tailwind classes. In this case, we were missing the correct path to the CSS files. 

Here is the corrected `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './styles.css'], // Include the CSS file here
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

By including the path to the `styles.css` file, Tailwind can correctly identify and include the custom classes defined within it. Alternatively, ensuring all html and js files that use Tailwind classes are also included in the content array will resolve the issue.
