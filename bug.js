I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I inspected the generated CSS and found that some of my custom classes were missing.  My Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js) appeared to be correct, and I had properly imported the Tailwind directives into my CSS file. I've tried restarting my development server multiple times.  The missing classes are not being purged, they should be included in the final CSS output.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">This should be red</div>
<div class="bg-custom-blue p-4">This should be a custom blue</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

.bg-custom-blue { /*this is the custom class*/
  @apply bg-blue-700;
}
```
